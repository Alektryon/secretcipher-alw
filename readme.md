Changes by @Alektryon (as of March 15, 2023):<br>
— Changed the default English cipher from NAEQ (New Aeon English Qaballa) to AQ (Alphanumeric Qabbala):  basically a continuous, non-redundant, alphanumeric sequence from 0 to Z=35;<br>
— Corrected some misspellings ("Forititude" -> "Fortitude", "Osirus" -> "Osiris", etc).
